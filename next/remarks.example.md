# Instructions

0.  Create an empty file `remarks.md` in your submission directory
(alternatively after reading this file, delete everything in it and rename it
`remarks.md`).

1.  For help with markdown format please see this [helpful
guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

2.  Please see and follow the [IOCCC markdown
guidelines](https://www.ioccc.org/markdown.html). Doing this helps the judges
integrate your remarks into a `README.md`, should you win.

3. After reading this file, write your remarks in your `remarks.md` file (as
mentioned in step 0).

4. When packaging your submission with `mkiocccentry(1)`, make sure that the
`remarks.md` is in the `topdir`.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: make **SURE** you read the IOCCC
[Rules](https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html) and
[Guidelines](https://www.ioccc.org/next/guidelines.html)!
